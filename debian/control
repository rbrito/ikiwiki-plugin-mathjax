Description: plugin for ikiwiki to allow Math formatted with MathJax
 This plugin makes it easy to use MathJax in IkiWiki. Some features:
 .
  * No changes to page.tmpl are needed -- the MathJax JavaScript is only
    loaded on pages where it is needed.
 .
  * Both display ($$...$$ or \[...\]) and inline ($...$ or \(...\)) math are
    supported. Just take care that inline math must stay on one line in your
    markdown source. A single literal dollar sign in a line does not need to
    be escaped, but two do.
 .
 The MathJax configuration is currently not adjustable without editing the
 source of the module.
