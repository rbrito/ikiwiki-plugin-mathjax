Description: plugin for ikiwiki to allow Math formatted with MathJax
 This plugin makes it easy to use MathJax in IkiWiki. Features:
 .
 * No changes to page.tmpl are needed -- the MathJax Javascript is only
 loaded on pages where it is needed.
 .
 * Both display ($$...$$ or \[...\]) and inline ($...$ or \(...\)) math are
 supported. Just take care that inline math must stay on one line in your
 markdown source. A single literal dollar sign in a line does not need to be
 escaped, but two do.
 .
 If you want to change the MathJax configuration, you currently must edit the
 source of the module. I may later add configuration hooks so that one may
 control its behaviour through the setup file for the wiki. Let me know if
 you need this.
